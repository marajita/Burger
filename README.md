# Eat-Da-Burger!

# Description
This application is a simple full stack application with a front end implemented with HTML/CSS (HTML templating is done with the help of Handlebars) and elements from the Bootstrap framework. The backend implemented with Node.js and Express. 

The user can enter any burger name to add it to the menu. This adds the new burger entry into the MySQL database. The burger entry is added as available on the menu and placed on the left side of the screen. The user may then eat any burger by clicking on the devour it button, which moves it into the right side of the screen and updates its status accordingly in the database from 0 to 1.
